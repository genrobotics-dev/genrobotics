                <h1>Rehabilitation Robotics - Redefining Mobility, Recovery & Human Dignity</h1>
                <h2>India’s Most Advanced Robotic Rehabilitation System for Stroke & Mobility Recovery</h2>
                <p>
                    Genrobotics introduces G-Gaiter, a next-generation rehabilitation robot designed to accelerate
                    mobility recovery with precision, safety, and AI-assisted therapy. Built for stroke survivors, spinal
                    cord injury patients, and individuals with mobility impairment, G-Gaiter delivers scientifically
                    optimized gait training that is impossible to replicate through manual physiotherapy alone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With advanced biomechanics, AI-driven feedback, and natural gait simulation, G-Gaiter is
                    redefining how India approaches neuro-rehabilitation and robotic physiotherapy.
                </p>

                <h3>The Future of Mobility Rehabilitation Starts Here</h3>
                <p>Every year, millions of patients in India struggle with mobility loss due to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Stroke</li>
                    <li>Spinal cord injuries</li>
                    <li>Traumatic brain injuries</li>
                    <li>Cerebral palsy</li>
                    <li>Neuro-muscular disorders</li>
                    <li>Orthopedic surgeries</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Traditional therapy often cannot provide the high-repetition, intensity, and precision required for
                    effective neurological recovery.
                </p>
                <p><strong>This is where robotic rehabilitation changes everything.</strong></p>
